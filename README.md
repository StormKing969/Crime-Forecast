This is still a work-in-progress program. So far it will just take in the data as a .csv file. Then it will convert and plot their occurrence in a specified grid of lengths 331 by 390 onto a .txt file and display their location on the screen. 

In order to make it work you'll have to download a python package called "PyGame". It is available on this website "http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame". Just be sure to download the correct version depend on the python version you are using.
