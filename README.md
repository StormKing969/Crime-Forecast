This is still a work-in-progress program. 

The Coordinates Program will just take in the data from the .csv file. Then it will convert and plot their occurrence in a specified grid of lengths 331 by 390 onto a .txt file. 

As for the KMean Program, it will use the data and form 2 clusters in which it will try to look for the best centroid in each one. Unfortunately due to the size of the .cvs file, no real centroid will be found.
