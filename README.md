This is still a work-in-progress program. 

The Coordinates Program will just take in the data from the .csv file. Then it will convert and plot their occurrence in a specified grid of lengths 331 by 390 onto a .txt file. 

The KMean Program will randomly take two locations as the centroids. Then it will proceed to look for the best location of the centroid in each clusters. After that it will display a screen showing all the points and the centroids will be marked as "X". It should take about 5 minutes for the screen to be displayed.
